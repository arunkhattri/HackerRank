* Problem
You are given a function . 
$f(x) = X ^ 2$

You are also given $K$ lists. The $i^{th}$ list consists of $N_i$ elements.

You have to pick one element from each list so that the value from the equation
below is maximized:

$X_i$ denotes the element picked from the $i^{th}$ list . Find the maximized value
$S_{max}$ obtained.

% denotes the modulo operator.

Note that you need to take exactly one element from each list, not necessarily
the largest element. You add the squares of the chosen elements and perform the
modulo operation. The maximum value that you can obtain, will be the answer to
the problem.

* Constraints

$1 \le K \le 7$ 
$1 \le M \le 1000$ 
$1 \le N_i \le 7$ 
$1 \le Magnitude of elements in list \le 10^9$
